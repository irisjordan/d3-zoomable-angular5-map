# D3 Zoomable Angular5 Map

This this my first D3 map. It is based on an example from Michelle Chandra http://bl.ocks.org/michellechandra/0b2ce4923dc9b5809922, but modified to use D3 version 5 and pulled into an Angular 5 project. I also added zooming and panning of the map and a dropdown that lets you change the dataset upon which the map circles are redrawn.

## Example Image
![Map](src/assets/map.png?raw=true "Title")

## See a running example

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

<!-- ## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
